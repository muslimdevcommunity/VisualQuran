## How to contribute

- Review the [open issues](https://github.com/muslimdevscommunity/VisualQuran/issues) for a list of known issues and proposed features.

- Pull the latest changes from "upstream" and push these changes to your forked "origin". You'll need to repeat this step each time you plan to contribute.

  ```sh
  git checkout master
  git fetch upstream
  git rebase upstream/master
  git push -f origin master
  ```

- Make a branch for your feature or fix. It's a good practice to make a separate branch for each feature or fix.

  ```sh
  git checkout -b branchName
  ```

- Employ your technical chops to resolve an issue or develop a proposed feature. Be sure your code follows our practices, as observed in our source code.

- Run the following commands before you switch from your current branch to a new branch, to prevent leaking the changes on your current branch to another branch. The `git status` commands shows you the modified files, and `git add .` adds all the changed files to the staging area. The`git commit` command moves the files from the staging area and makes a commit in the branch. Only the committed changes can be pushed.

  ```sh
  git status
  git add .
  git commit -m "this is a commit"
  ```

- When you're done making changes, push your branch to the "origin". The `-u` flag links this branch with the remote branch, so that in the future you can simply type `git push origin`.

  ```sh
  git push -u origin branchName
  ```

- Navigate to the ["VisualQuran project repository"](https://github.com/muslimdevscommunity/VisualQuran) on GitHub. Click on the "Pull Request" button in the project header. Enter a title and description of your pull request, and click on the green "Send pull request" button.

- Your code will be reviewed. You can also continue to push to your branch in light of discussion and feedback about your commits.

Contributions are what make the open source community an amazing place to learn, inspire, and develop together. The contributions you make are _appreciated_.
